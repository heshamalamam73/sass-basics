7 benefits of using SASS over conventional CSS

What is SASS?
SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS pre-processor that lets you use variables, mathematical operations, mixins, loops, functions, imports, and other interesting functionalities that make writing CSS much more powerful. In some ways, you may think of SASS as a style sheet extension language because it extends the standard CSS characteristics by introducing the benefits of a basic programming language. So SASS will compile your code and generate the CSS output a browser can understand.

Yes, you just read "programming language" but it really is basic stuff. If you are a programmer, it will only take you 15 minutes to get SASS. But if you have no experience coding, then your learning curve will be a little higher. Once you learn CSS with SASS, you won't write CSS from scratch anymore.

Of course, by doing this you are not using any of the superpowers and abilities SASS provides, but at least you realize you don't need to spend hours and hours to start using SASS. From this starting point, you would be able to learn the SASS syntax as you go.

Here's where you can learn about the SASS basics.
